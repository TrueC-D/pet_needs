The primary purpose of this app is to track pet needs and have the ability to record when the need has been met. In the future the pets should have many users and users should have many pets, that way multiple people in a household will be able to record when their pets' needs have been met. 

Ideally  in the future there will also be permissions set so a guest user can also be created for which they will not be able to modify the saved needs for that pet and simply mark things off as completed.

testing: can you read this?
